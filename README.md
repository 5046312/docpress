# docpress

Documentation website generator.

[![Status](https://travis-ci.org/docpress/docpress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/docpress/docpress "See test builds")

Docpress generates websites from your project's basic documentation; that is, at the very least, a `README.md` file. It also supports multiple Markdown pages in `docs/`.

Under heavy development now; guides and instructions will magically appear here when we're stable.

## Examples

* http://ricostacruz.com/dom101 (single readme)
* http://ricostacruz.com/onmount (multiple pages)

## Usage

Still under heavy development, consider this a preview.
See the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md) guide for more details.

```
npm install -g docpress
```
