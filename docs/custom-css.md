# Custom CSS

Create a file called `docs/assets/custom.scss` in your project. If you prefer Sass's indented syntax, use `.sass` as an extension.

## Customizing variables

Create a file called `docs/assets/variables.scss` in your project. This allows you to change variables.

```scss
$accent: #129;
```
