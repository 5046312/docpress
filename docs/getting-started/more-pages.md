# Writing more pages

Add them to the table of contents.

## Create your TOC

Create a table of contents as `docs/README.md`. This is the table of contents: an unordered list of pages to link. Here's an example that will only have one file (your main README).

```md
Documentation
=============

* [Your project](../README.md)
```

You can make it bold (`**[Your project](../README.md)**`) to expand it's contents in the sidebar.
